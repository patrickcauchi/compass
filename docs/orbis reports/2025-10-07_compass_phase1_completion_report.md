# 🧭 Compass Semantic Infrastructure — Phase 1 Completion Report
**System:** Compass v0.5.0 – “Functional Recursion”  
**Filed by:** Architect Orbis  
**Date:** 2025-10-07  

---

## 🧱 Overview
This report documents the successful completion of **Phase 1** of the Compass project — transitioning from a semantic scaffold to a functional, self-aware UI.  
Compass is now a **deterministic, semantically parsed, and visually operational** application foundation.

---

## ⚙️ Phase Summary
| Phase | Focus | Result |
|--------|--------|---------|
| **v0.1 – Tree-sitter Bootstrap** | Verify AST parsing + venv stability | ✅ Operational Tree-sitter pipeline |
| **v0.2 – Pack Scaffold** | Generate deterministic metadata files | ✅ Stable pack structure (`super_index`, `dep_graph`, `chunks_meta`, `manifest`) |
| **v0.3 – Structural Extractor** | Capture AST-level chunks | ✅ 24 structural nodes parsed deterministically |
| **v0.4 – Query Templates** | Add language-specific query rules | ✅ TSX / JS / CSS templates integrated |
| **v0.5 – Core UI** | Build first functional dashboard UI | ✅ Compass visual interface online |

---

## 📦 Artifact Summary (v0.5.0)
| File | Purpose |
|------|----------|
| `packs/super_index.json` | File inventory (7 files, deterministic metadata) |
| `packs/dep_graph.json` | Directed dependency tree (4 edges, 1 external) |
| `packs/chunks_meta.jsonl` | 38 structural chunks (AST captures) |
| `packs/pack_manifest.json` | Provenance + schema summary |
| `tools/extract_structural.py` | Tree-sitter query-based structural extractor |
| `tools/query_templates.py` | Language-specific AST queries |
| `src/app/` | Layout + Page entrypoints |
| `src/components/` | 5 functional React components |
| `src/styles/globals.css` | TailwindCSS directives |

✅ Deterministic rebuilds  
✅ Stable dependency topology  
✅ AST-level semantic awareness across languages  

---

## 🧩 Functional Milestones
- **Semantic recursion loop complete:** Orbis ↔ Copilot ↔ Scanner synchronization verified  
- **Core UI operational:** Header, Wheel, RegimeDisplay, AllocationPanel visible at `localhost:3000`  
- **Structural metadata rich:** 38 AST captures across 7 modules  
- **System self-awareness established:** Compass now understands its own file, function, and JSX hierarchy

## 🧠 State of the System
| Layer | Status | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| Semantic Engine | ✅ Stable | Deterministic, language-aware |
| Frontend Runtime | ✅ Active | Functional Next.js + Tailwind UI |
| Data Layer | 🚧 Mock | Placeholder allocations |
| Indicators Layer | 🔜 Planned | Next phase (mock indicator cards) |
| Backend / Supabase | ⏳ Future | Integration planned v0.7+ |

---

## 🔁 Orbis–Copilot–Scanner Contract
| Role | Responsibility |
|------|----------------|
| **Orbis (Architect)** | Reason about packs, issue change briefs, validate structure |
| **Copilot (Developer)** | Implement scoped changes, maintain AST integrity |
| **Scanner (Tree-sitter)** | Regenerate packs deterministically |

This contract remains the foundation for all future Compass phases.

---

## 🚀 Next Steps
1. **Open two new chats:**
   - 🧠 *Architect Orbis* → external reasoning, briefs, validation  
   - 🛠️ *Developer Copilot* → IDE-level code edits + regeneration  
2. Proceed to:
   - **Change Brief #9 — Mock Indicator Dashboard** (adds indicator cards with mock metrics).  
   - Run semantic verification after build (`python tools/scan_full.py`).  

---

## ✅ Status: Phase 1 — COMPLETE
Compass is now:
> A **self-aware**, **functionally active**, and **semantically recursive** system.  
> Ready for multi-agent development and analytical feature expansion.
