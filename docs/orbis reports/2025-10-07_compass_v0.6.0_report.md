# 🧭 Compass Semantic Infrastructure — Daily Completion Report
**Date:** 2025-10-07  
**Filed by:** Architect Orbis  
**System:** Compass v0.6.0 – “Functional Depth”  

---

## 🧱 Context
This session represented a major stabilisation and design consolidation cycle for Compass — evolving the system from its first functional UI to a fully coherent design layer and preparing the semantic foundation for deterministic recursion.

All changes executed within the **Compass Semantic Infrastructure v0.5.0 → v0.6.0** range.

## ⚙️ Batches Completed

| Batch | Focus | Result |
|--------|--------|---------|
| **8.1 – Design Tokens & Utilities** | Introduced Tailwind tokens, glass utilities, and typography helpers; resolved multi-version Tailwind issues. | ✅ Stable build; Tailwind pipeline clean. |
| **8.2 – Header Polish** | Added translucent, fixed header with blur and border; accessibility compliant. | ✅ Functional + aesthetic upgrade. |
| **8.3 – Layout Frame & Spacing** | Established dark shell, centered layout, and vertical rhythm. | ✅ Clean, responsive frame; ready for nested sections. |
| **8.4 – Allocation Components Styling** | Applied glassmorphism and glow to AllocationWheel, RegimeDisplay, and AllocationPanel. | ✅ Dashboard achieves Compass identity (“clarity = credibility”). |
| **8.5 – IndicatorSection (Mock)** | Implemented 4-card mock indicator section with responsive grid and trend pills. | ✅ System visual completeness achieved. |

---

## 📦 Semantic Artifacts
- Updated **packs**: `super_index.json`, `dep_graph.json`, `chunks_meta.jsonl`, `pack_manifest.json`.  
- Verified **11 files / 70 structural chunks** (consistent growth since bootstrap).  
- Semantic relations validated between `Header`, `layout`, and new components.  
- Dependency normalization check triggered (relative path alias noted).

## 🧩 Structural State
| Layer | Status | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| Semantic Engine | ✅ Stable | Tree-sitter parsing consistent across app. |
| Frontend Runtime | ✅ Active | Full functional Next.js interface. |
| Design System | ✅ Integrated | Unified Tailwind + glass helpers. |
| Indicators Layer | 🚧 Mock | Static placeholders; dynamic version planned. |
| Backend / Supabase | ⏳ Deferred | Scheduled for post-semantic optimisation. |

## 📜 Documentation Created
- `future_indicator_dashboard_plan.md` — defines `/indicators` roadmap (Phase 1–3).  
- `semantic_optimisation_path.md` — defines ten-step plan for deterministic recursion and pack enrichment.  

Both committed under `/docs/`.

---

## 🧠 Lessons & Key Fixes
- **Root Cause of CSS Errors:** Tailwind v4 + `@apply` incompatibility → resolved via pure CSS helpers.  
- **Pipeline Stability:** verified with working `.glass` utility and class-only component edits.  
- **Semantic Consistency:** pack updates match UI evolution; no AST corruption.  
- **Process Optimization:** established a clear batch workflow (8.1–8.5 complete) and a semantic optimisation roadmap (S-1 → S-5 next).

## 🚀 Next Phase

### Phase S – Semantic Optimisation  
Focus: deterministic pack generation and cross-platform reproducibility.

| Step | Title | Objective |
|------|--------|-----------|
| **S-1** | Path Normalisation | Convert all pack paths to POSIX + canonical form. |
| **S-2** | Schema v1.1 | Add digests + tooling metadata. |
| **S-3** | Dep Graph Edge Typing | Distinguish import vs re-export vs external. |
| **S-4** | Editable/Frozen Flags | Prepare chunk-level permissioning. |
| **S-5** | CI Verification | Automated semantic consistency checks. |

Once Phase S completes, we proceed to **Change Brief #9 — Mock Indicator Dashboard v1**, extending the `/indicators` route.

---

## ✅ Summary
Compass v0.6.0 is now:
> **Visually complete, semantically consistent, and ready for deterministic optimisation.**  
> The UI, packs, and design language are unified under the “clarity = credibility” principle.
