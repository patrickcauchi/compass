# üß± Compass Foundation Notes

## 1. Core Model Philosophy
- Compass is **not predictive** ‚Äî it‚Äôs *inferential* and *regime-based*.
- It estimates **probability-weighted direction**, guiding allocation rather than forecasting prices.
- Weekly cadence is deliberate: **discipline over reactivity**.

## 2. Architecture Simplification
- Begin with **Supabase** for database + backend, add **Node microservice** later for heavy computation.
- MVP: **Next.js PWA** (mobile-first responsive).
- Live prices refresh ~1‚Äì5 min for UX; signals update **weekly**.
- Core metaphor:  
  - **M2/Fed/DXY** = the *tide*  
  - **ETF flows / stablecoins** = the *wind*  
  - **BTC / ETH / USDT** = the *sails*

## 3. Minimum Effective Product
- Launch Compass with only:
  - Liquidity + Flow indicators.
  - Three fixed regime buckets (Risk-On / Neutral / Risk-Off).
  - Simple BTC/ETH/USDT allocation map.
- This alone is viable as a $10/month SaaS tool.

## 4. Retention Reality
- Macro is slow; user boredom is the main risk.
- Retention strategy:
  - Frame inactivity as *capital preservation*.
  - Publish a short weekly ‚ÄúCompass Commentary.‚Äù
  - Add Compare Compass + Backtester for engagement.

## 5. Regulatory & Trust Posture
- Present as **educational / research software**, not advice.
- Avoid ‚Äúbuy/sell‚Äù language ‚Äî use ‚ÄúCompass indicates / suggests.‚Äù
- Maintain clear disclaimers and read-only model.
- Operate safely as an analytics SaaS within Australian regulations.

## 6. Productization Strategy
- **Hybrid business model**:
  - Trade your own portfolio (internal alpha).
  - Offer SaaS subscription for scalable revenue.
- Accept cyclic revenue ‚Äî bull cycles drive adoption.
- Free tier = funnel ‚Üí Core ($10) = sticky ‚Üí Pro ($30) = serious ‚Üí Enterprise ($100+) = scalable.

## 7. Expansion Vision
- Enterprise tier adds:
  - Custom indicator builder.
  - Multi-asset expansion (top alts, gold, equities indices).
  - AI Analyst for commentary and what-if scenarios.
- Long-term goal: **Cross-asset macro platform** with semantic AI narrative layer.

## 8. Cultural Identity
- Brand ethos: ‚ÄúDiscipline, not dopamine.‚Äù
- Compass is the **antidote to degen trading** ‚Äî calm, informed, risk-aware.
- Every new feature must reinforce clarity, preservation, and education.

**Purpose:** These notes preserve the strategic context and philosophy governing Compass development beyond the MVP.
