# Change Brief #8 — Core UI (RegimeDisplay + AllocationPanel)

Date: 2025-10-07
Filed by: Architect Orbis
System: Compass Semantic Infrastructure v0.5.0

## Request
Establish the first functional UI layer of Compass. Add a live visual dashboard showing current regime (Risk-On / Neutral / Risk-Off) and BTC/ETH/USDT allocation panel (mock data, static values). No backend yet.

## Actions Taken
- Created new React components:
  - `src/components/RegimeDisplay.tsx` (regime visualization)
  - `src/components/AllocationPanel.tsx` (allocation progress bars)
- Updated main page:
  - `src/app/page.tsx` renders AllocationWheel, RegimeDisplay, and AllocationPanel with mock state
- Applied Tailwind CSS for clean, minimal design
- Verified rendering at http://localhost:3000 (header, wheel, regime, allocation bars)
- Regenerated packs (`python tools/scan_full.py`):
  - 7 files detected, 38 chunks, new components and edges present

## Output Files
- Added
  - `src/components/RegimeDisplay.tsx`
  - `src/components/AllocationPanel.tsx`
- Updated
  - `src/app/page.tsx`
- Packs (regenerated)
  - `packs/super_index.json`
  - `packs/chunks_meta.jsonl`
  - `packs/dep_graph.json`
  - `packs/pack_manifest.json`

## Verification
- Dev server: PASS (UI renders as specified, no errors)
- Responsive layout: PASS (bars scale, regime color updates)
- Packs: PASS (new components and edges present, chunk count increased)
- Determinism: Repeated scans produce stable counts and order

## Notes & Issues
- All values are static placeholders; no backend or live data yet
- Ready for indicator dashboard integration (next phase)

## Next Steps
- Change Brief #9 — Mock Indicator Dashboard: Add indicator cards (Liquidity, ETF Flows, Stablecoin Growth) with mock values

## Commands Run (for reproducibility)
- UI scaffold:
  - Created/updated components and page file
- Dev server:
  - `npm run dev`
- Packs:
  - `.\.venv\Scripts\python tools\scan_full.py`

✅ Core UI layer complete, packs updated, ready for next phase.
