# Change Brief #3 — Dependency Graph + Pack Manifest

## Request
Add the final two metadata artifacts to complete the Compass pack set:
- `dep_graph.json`: import relationships between source files
- `pack_manifest.json`: top-level summary (counts, timestamps, schema version)

Update:
- Extend `tools/extract_basic.py` with import extraction
- Create `tools/scan_full.py` to build all four pack files

## Actions Taken
1. Fixed and added top-level `get_imports(path)` to `tools/extract_basic.py` for extracting import specifiers.
2. Created `tools/scan_full.py`:
   - Imports helpers from `extract_basic.py`
   - Builds `super_index.json`, `dep_graph.json`, `chunks_meta.jsonl`, and `pack_manifest.json` in `/packs`
   - Prints summary counts for files, chunks, edges, and externals
3. Ran `python tools/scan_full.py` — script executed with no import or parser errors.

## Output
- `/packs/super_index.json`: inventory of all `.ts`/`.tsx` files in `/src`
- `/packs/dep_graph.json`: import relationships and external dependencies
- `/packs/chunks_meta.jsonl`: one JSON object per top-level declaration
- `/packs/pack_manifest.json`: summary with schema version, build timestamp, counts, and artifact list
- Console output confirms file/chunk/edge/external counts

## Summary
- Compass pack set is now complete and self-describing
- All four metadata files build cleanly
- Tree-sitter runs without errors
- Ready for ingestion by Architect Orbis
- No issues encountered
