# Compass Change Report — Batch 8.3: Layout Frame & Spacing (App Shell)

**Date:** 2025-10-07
**Author:** Developer Copilot

## Request Summary

Architect Orbis briefed the following:
- Create a stable, responsive visual frame for the Compass app.
- Ensure consistent margins, header offset, and centered layout.
- Edit only `src/app/layout.tsx` and (optionally) `src/app/page.tsx`.
- Use Tailwind className utilities only; no CSS/config/prop changes.

## Actions Taken

### 1. `src/app/layout.tsx`
- Replaced with a new app shell structure:
  - Global dark background (`bg-gray-950`) and calm text (`text-gray-200`).
  - Centered layout (`flex flex-col items-center`, `max-w-4xl`, `px-4`).
  - Top offset for fixed header (`pt-24`), vertical breathing room (`space-y-12`).
  - Responsive and accessible; no logic or new components added.

### 2. `src/app/page.tsx` (optional)
- Wrapped content in a flex container for consistent vertical spacing and centering.
- No functional changes; harmonizes spacing between core panels.

## Output Files
- `src/app/layout.tsx` (fully replaced)
- `src/app/page.tsx` (outer wrapper updated)

## Verification & Results
- App builds cleanly; no Tailwind or CSS errors.
- Layout is dark, centered, and responsive; header is fixed and content sits below.
- All three panels have even vertical rhythm; no scrollbars or layout shift.
- Scanner run: packs updated, only layout and page files changed.

## Next Steps
- Visual scaffold is ready for future component styling (Batch 8.4).
- Rollback is single-file revert for layout/page files.
