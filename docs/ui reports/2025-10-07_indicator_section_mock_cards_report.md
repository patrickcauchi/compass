**Date:** 2025-10-07

## Request Summary

Architect Orbis briefed the following:
- Add a presentational IndicatorSection below AllocationPanel, showing 4 mock indicator cards.
- Match Compass aesthetic: glass panels, calm typography, semantic headings, readable contrast.
- No data fetching; placeholder values only. ClassName-only; no CSS/config edits.
- Edit only `src/components/IndicatorSection.tsx` (new) and `src/app/page.tsx` (import/render).

## Actions Taken

### 1. `src/components/IndicatorSection.tsx` (new)
- Created a new component:
  - Renders 4 mock indicator cards in a responsive grid (1-col mobile, 2-col ≥sm).
  - Each card: glass panel, title (small gray), value (prominent), sublabel, and a trend pill (up/flat).
  - Accessible markup: semantic headings, logical focus order.

### 2. `src/app/page.tsx`
- Imported and rendered `IndicatorSection` below `AllocationPanel`.
- No changes to props or logic in existing components.

## Output Files
- `src/components/IndicatorSection.tsx` (new)
- `src/app/page.tsx` (updated)

## Verification & Results
- App builds cleanly; no Tailwind/CSS errors.
- Main dashboard shows "Key Indicators (Mock)" section with 4 glass cards.
- Cards are responsive, spaced, and visually consistent with Compass design.
- Scanner run: packs updated, only page and new component files changed.

## Next Steps
- Ready for richer mock values and analytics in the Indicator Dashboard (Batch 9).
- Rollback is single-file removal of IndicatorSection and revert of page.tsx.
