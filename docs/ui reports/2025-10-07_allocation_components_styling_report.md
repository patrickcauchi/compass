## Request Summary

Architect Orbis briefed the following:
- Polish the three core dashboard components (AllocationWheel, RegimeDisplay, AllocationPanel) to match Compass design language.
- Add glassmorphism, glow, and structured spacing for clarity and credibility.
- No logic changes; visuals only. Edit only the three component files.

## Actions Taken

### 1. `src/components/AllocationWheel.tsx`
- Styled as a glowing, glassmorphic circular anchor.
- Soft blue ring, frosted inner surface, centered text with glow.

### 2. `src/components/RegimeDisplay.tsx`
- Large, color-coded regime title with soft glow and smooth color transitions.
- Responsive and accessible; color adapts to regime value.

### 3. `src/components/AllocationPanel.tsx`
- Frosted glass card with three proportional, colored progress bars (BTC, ETH, USDT).
- Calm gray text, aligned numbers, and structured vertical spacing.

## Output Files
- `src/components/AllocationWheel.tsx` (styled)
- `src/components/RegimeDisplay.tsx` (styled)
- `src/components/AllocationPanel.tsx` (styled)

## Verification & Results
- App builds with no Tailwind or CSS errors; all components display polished, frosted surfaces.
- Regime text glows softly; bars are proportional and colored distinctly.
- Layout spacing matches the main frame’s rhythm; responsive down to mobile.
- Scanner run: packs updated, only the three component files changed.

## Next Steps
- Dashboard aesthetic complete; ready for IndicatorSection mock dashboard in Batch 8.5.
- Rollback is single-file revert for any component.
