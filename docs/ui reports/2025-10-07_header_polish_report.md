**Date:** 2025-10-07

## Request Summary

Architect Orbis briefed the following:
- Upgrade the header to a fixed, translucent top bar with blur, border, and accessible nav.
- Edit only `src/components/Header.tsx` — no CSS or config changes.
- Use standard Tailwind utilities in JSX only; keep it responsive and accessible.

## Actions Taken

### 1. `src/components/Header.tsx`
- Replaced with a new component:
  - Fixed top bar (`fixed top-0 left-0 right-0 z-50`)
  - Translucent background (`bg-gray-900/60 backdrop-blur-md`)
  - Subtle border (`border-b border-gray-800`)
  - Responsive layout (`max-w-5xl`, flex, gap, px-4 py-3)
  - Accessible nav with keyboard focus rings and aria labels
  - Desktop: nav links visible, hover/focus states, no scrollbars
  - Mobile: logo left, menu placeholder right, no layout shift
  - Contrast meets AA for text on header background
- No prop changes, no new dependencies, no global styles touched.

## Output Files
- `src/components/Header.tsx` (fully replaced)

## Verification & Results
- App builds and renders with no Tailwind CSS errors.
- Header is fixed, translucent, blurred, and has a subtle border.
- Desktop and mobile layouts verified; nav links and focus states work.
- Scanner run: packs updated, only `Header.tsx` changed.

## Next Steps
- Header ready for future menu interactivity and further polish.
- No other files affected; rollback is single-file revert.
