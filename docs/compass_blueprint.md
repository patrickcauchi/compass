# üß≠ Compass ‚Äî Application Blueprint

## Vision
Compass is a **macro crypto allocation compass**.  
It helps users balance between **BTC / ETH / USDT** (the triangle) based on a set of **key macro + crypto indicators**.  
The philosophy: **simplicity is the edge** ‚Äî avoid noise, follow the tide + flows.

---

## Core Philosophy
- **Liquidity = tide** ‚Üí macro backdrop that lifts or sinks all ships.  
- **Flows = wind** ‚Üí crypto-specific capital inflows/outflows.  
- **BTC / ETH / USDT = sails** ‚Üí allocations shift weekly according to risk regime.  
- **Education-first**: Compass is an *analytics + research tool*, not financial advice.  
- **Retention through clarity**: Users stay because Compass preserves capital and explains itself.

### üí∏ Crypto Flows (Capital In/Out)
