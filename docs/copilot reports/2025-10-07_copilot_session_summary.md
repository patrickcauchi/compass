## Session Overview

Today’s session delivered five focused UI and infrastructure batches for Compass, each brief-driven and fully verified:

### Batch 8.1 — Design Tokens & Safety Net
- Extended Tailwind config with semantic tokens (btc, eth, usdt, glass, glow).
- Added glass, num, text-glow, divider, heading, mono utilities in pure CSS.
- Created feature flag helper.
- No visual changes; app and packs stable.

### Batch 8.2 — Header Polish
- Replaced header with a fixed, translucent, blurred top bar using Tailwind utilities in JSX.
- Improved accessibility and responsive nav.
- Only `Header.tsx` changed; no CSS/config edits.

### Batch 8.3 — Layout Frame & Spacing
- Refactored app shell for centered, responsive layout and header offset.
- Updated `layout.tsx` and (optionally) `page.tsx` for consistent rhythm.

### Batch 8.4 — Allocation Components Styling
- Styled `AllocationWheel`, `RegimeDisplay`, and `AllocationPanel` with glassmorphism, glow, and structured spacing.
- No logic changes; only className and markup updates.

### Batch 8.5 — IndicatorSection (Mock Cards)
- Added new `IndicatorSection` with 4 mock glass cards below AllocationPanel.
- Updated `page.tsx` to render the section; all cards responsive and accessible.

## Verification & Results
- All changes were brief-driven, deterministic, and isolated to specified files.
- App builds cleanly after each batch; no Tailwind or CSS errors.
- Scanner run after each batch: packs updated, only expected files changed.
- Reports generated for each batch in `/docs/ui reports/`.

## Next Steps
- Ready for Batch 9: Mock Indicator Dashboard v1.
- All work today is rollback-safe (single-file reverts).
