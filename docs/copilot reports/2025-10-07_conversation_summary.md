## Overview
This report summarizes all major changes, iterations, and outcomes from the current development session, tracking the evolution of Compass from initial setup to core UI and semantic infrastructure.

## Iteration Timeline

### 1. Environment & Scaffold Initialization
- Installed Next.js, React, Tailwind, Headless UI, Heroicons
- Created package.json, Tailwind/PostCSS configs, global styles
- Scaffolded minimal App Router layout and page
- Verified dev server and packs regeneration

### 2. UI Scaffold (Header + AllocationWheel)
- Added Header and AllocationWheel components
- Updated layout and page to render header and wheel
- Confirmed UI and pack updates

### 3. Structural Extraction (Tree-sitter)
- Implemented extract_structural.py for AST-level chunk extraction
- Updated scan_full.py to use structural extractor
- Verified packs: multiple chunks per file, stable super_index and dep_graph

### 4. Query Template Integration
- Added query_templates.py with TSX, JS, CSS queries
- Integrated queries into extractor for richer semantic capture
- Confirmed deterministic output and chunk density

### 5. Core UI Layer (RegimeDisplay + AllocationPanel)
- Added RegimeDisplay and AllocationPanel components
- Updated page to show regime and allocation bars with mock state
- Verified UI, packs, and deterministic rebuild

## Pack Artifacts
- super_index.json: file inventory
- dep_graph.json: dependency graph
- chunks_meta.jsonl: structural/semantic chunks
- pack_manifest.json: build metadata

## Reporting
- Change reports generated for each major brief in docs/change reports
- Session summary recorded here for Orbis and Copilot reference

## Next Steps
- Proceed to indicator dashboard (mock analytics)
- Continue semantic recursion and compression policy

## Session Outcome
Compass is now scaffolded with a functional, semantic, and query-aware UI and metadata system, ready for further analytics and backend integration.
